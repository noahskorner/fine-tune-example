The characters are strong and likeable too.\r\nCharacter B: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?\r\nCharacter A: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here.

Apparently it's supposed to be a database of all the young up-and-coming hockey stars. Scouts use that information for future contracts, etc.\r\nCharacter B: OK, but our kids are 10 years old! They're not signing any contracts for now :)\r\nCharacter A: Well, obviously not, but it's kind of cool that they'll be in a world database of peewee hockey players.\r\nCharacter B: Yeah, I guess. So apparently the tests are supposed to last 5-8 pm. 3 hours! I'll probably wait and work on the computer.\r\nCharacter A: Bring a blanket :) It can get mighty cold sitting in a rink for 3 hours.\r\nCharacter B: No shit :) Are you coming.\r\nCharacter A: Well, since you're going anyway, maybe you can take my kid :) \r\nCharacter B: Hey, that's not fair! \r\nCharacter A: I'll take the kids next time, I promise!\r\nCharacter B: Yeah, yeah, we'll see.

What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.\r\nCharacter B: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!\r\nCharacter A: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.\r\nCharacter B: Oh dear! What could it mean?\r\nCharacter A: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.\r\nCharacter B: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.\r\nCharacter A: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.\r\nCharacter B: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.\r\nCharacter A: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.\r\nCharacter B: They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright?\r\nCharacter A: Sure. Thank you Sophie for a nice chat!\r\nCharacter B: Thank you for the quince!"

Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \r\nCharacter B: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\r\nCharacter A: Why is that?\r\nCharacter B: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\r\nCharacter A: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\r\nCharacter B: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\r\nCharacter A: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\r\nCharacter B: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\r\nCharacter A: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\r\nCharacter B: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \r\nCharacter A: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\r\nCharacter B: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \r\nCharacter A: So what would you recommend?\r\nCharacter B: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \r\nCharacter A: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \r\nCharacter B: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\r\nCharacter A: OK, is this something your company can help with?\r\nCharacter B: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \r\nCharacter A: Good point.
